About me
======

I am a researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}. After graduating in music therapy, pedagogy, psychology, music, and speech language pathology, I completed my PhD in the Faculty of [Psychologie, Logopédie et Sciences de l'Education](https://www.fplse.uliege.be/cms/c_4037467/en/faculte-de-psychologie-logo-et-sc-de-l-education){:target="_blank"}. I had the chance to work with [Sean Hutchins](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=urefqeoAAAAJ){:target="_blank"} and [Isabelle Peretz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=nQyfzPoAAAAJ){:target="_blank"} at [BRAMS](https://brams.org/){:target="_blank"}, to join the [APAL lab](https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/apal-pfordresher/){:target="_blank"} of [Peter Pfordresher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IK_ZAcYAAAAJ&hl=de){:target="_blank"}, the [Neuropragmatic and emotions lab](]https://www.mcgill.ca/pell_lab/){:target="_blank"} of [Marc Pell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=gKZxfasAAAAJ){:target="_blank"}, and to work for some years with [David Poeppel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=9EyT1mYAAAAJ){:target="_blank"} in the [Neuroscience Department of the MPIEA](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/former-departments/department-of-neuroscience.html){:target="_blank"} and the [Max Planck • NYU Center for Language Music and Emotion](https://clame.nyu.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

This background might disparate but no, it is all about Sounds and Meanings!

More generally, I enjoy science, playing piano & life (random order).
