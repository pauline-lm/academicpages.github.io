Welcome to my website!

I am Pauline Larrouy-Maestri. Here, you can find information [about me](https://pauline-lm.github.io/about/){:target="_blank"}, my on-going [research](https://pauline-lm.github.io/research/){:target="_blank"}, and my [publications](https://pauline-lm.github.io/publications/){:target="_blank"}. You can find a formal [CV](https://pauline-lm.github.io/cv/){:target="_blank"} that traces my paths through  music, language, voice, emotions, and cognition, to try to figure out how we make sense of sounds, as well as some thoughts / readings / discussions under [other stuff](https://pauline-lm.github.io/other/){:target="_blank"}.
