Talk by Iris van Rooij, at the Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science, and Semiotics & Interacting Minds Center, Aarhus University, 17-2-2022.* 

Iris van Rooij walks us through the task of Dr Conjectura who wants to solve a problem (i.e., to find an algorithm behind a certain function). It is an articulated demonstration that cognitive sciences is full of uncertainty and cannot be automated. Very thoughtful talk, challenging ideas, and a somehow positive final quote “Pluralism and indeterminacy are necessary for discovery”. I will definitely continue following her eye-opening tweets (@IrisVanRooij) and the [book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cognition-and-intractability/2FC21B94CCCFBBD1E11A2D30D4503A23){:target="_blank"} is on my list.
