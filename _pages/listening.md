**2022 - February**

*[How hard is cognitive science?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=2bdK_zu1Ikw){:target="_blank"}
Talk by Iris van Rooij, at the Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science, and Semiotics & Interacting Minds Center, Aarhus University, 17-2-2022.* 

Iris van Rooij walks us through the task of Dr Conjectura who wants to solve a problem (i.e., to find an algorithm behind a certain function). It is an articulated demonstration that cognitive sciences is full of uncertainty and cannot be automated. Very thoughtful talk, challenging ideas, and a somehow positive final quote “Pluralism and indeterminacy are necessary for discovery”. I will definitely continue following her eye-opening tweets (@IrisVanRooij) and the [book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cognition-and-intractability/2FC21B94CCCFBBD1E11A2D30D4503A23){:target="_blank"} is on my list.

Short video by Clémentine Coppolani, singer, and creator of the podcast [“La clé de la voix”](https://podcast.ausha.co/la-cle-de-la-voix){:target="_blank”}.*

Clémentine Coppolani discusses with [Nathalie Henrich Bernardoni](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=_Q8oL4sAAAAJ){:target="_blank”} and [Maëva Garnier](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=t7my_VUAAAAJ&hl=fr){:target="_blank”}, two researchers from the [GIPSA-lab / CNRS](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/){:target="_blank”}, about tools to analyse the voice and voice mechanisms. A good and easy introduction to the science of singing by two great colleagues. You can find other thoughtful questions of the Clémentine Coppolani in other episodes, including one in which we spoke (in french) about [singing accuracy](https://www.lacledelavoix.com/articles/saison-2-ep31-pauline-larrouy-maestri){:target="_blank”}.
