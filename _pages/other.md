### [Barbara Club](https://pauline-lm.github.io/barbara/){:target="_blank"} 
On a weekly basis, we (i.e., interested colleagues and students) read and discussed the work of Barbara Tillmann on musical structure. We will summarize here our thoughts on this fascinating work!


### [Readings & Lessons learned](https://pauline-lm.github.io/readings/){:target="_blank"} 
Links to old or recent papers that I'm excited about or lessons recently learned (after too many trials/errors or googling hours). Nothing fancy or pretentious, mainly memory notes, perhaps useful to others.
