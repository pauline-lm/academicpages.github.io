**2022 - February**

*Heintz, C., & Scott-Phillips, T. (2022). [Expression unleashed: The evolutionary & cognitive foundations of human communication.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983701/){:target="_blank"} Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 1-46. doi:10.1017/S0140525X22000012*

This target article defends the claim that the diversity of human expression is associated with an ensemble of cognitive capacities targeted at the expression/recognition of informative intentions. Grounded on the work of Grice (and many more since then) on cognitive pragmatics, the authors describe what is informative and communicative intentions through simple examples (see also this [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/thom_scott_phillips_how_communication_makes_us_human){:target="_blank”}) and define different types of inferences made by the audience: inferences about 1) others’ intentions, 2) others’ informative intentions, and 3) others’ communicative intentions. Whereas ostensive communication is not limited to language, it is a good reminder about its complexity. For a great introduction, read the inspiring book [Speaking our minds](https://thomscottphillips.com/book/){:target="_blank”} written by Thom Scott-Phillips.

Definitely looking forward to read the comments about the proposed cognitive capacities and their co-evolution!

Wojcik, E.H., Lassman, D.J., & Vuvan, D.T. (2022). [Using a developmental-ecological approach to understand the relation between language and music.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.762018/full){:targets="_blank"} Frontiers in Psychology. 13:762018. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.762018 

This short perspective article gives arguments to use a developmental-ecological approach in music-language studies. It has been repeatedly shown that implicit learning is key in development but what is the “real” input that we receive when growing up? Inspired by research in other fields (e.g., motor and semantic development), the authors defend that describing input in real life (and how it unfolds over time) is a good idea to document listeners experience (and understand better adult cognition). Of course, there are challenges (e.g., how can we code the input? is it music? language? do we even agree on that?) but it is a good reminder that lab experiments are limited and that “field” experiments in this domain could be helpful.
