*Luke S.G. (2017) [Evaluating significance in linear mixed-effects models in R.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27620283/){:targets="_blank"} Behavioral Research Methods, 49(4):1494-1502. doi: 10.3758/s13428-016-0809-y.*

Evaluating significance of fixed effects in mixed-effect models is tricky. One often sees likelihood ratio test (LRT, comparison of fit of two models) or Wald tests (based on distribution). Here, Steven G Luke reports the Type 1 error rate for different simulations (changing the number of subjects and items) and different methods (the two usual ones and alternatives). In short: nothing is perfect. Also, it is good to remember that Type 1 error is sensitive to both the number of subjects and items. In other words, we cannot make up for a small number of subjects but having many items (and vice versa). This short article nicely explains why there are good reasons that p-values are not included by default in packages like lme4 and that one has to actually think instead of reporting blindly p-values.

For more general thoughts on statistical methods used in psychological science, the work of [Geoff Cumming](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0YcrKmYAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank”}, such as [The New Statistics: Why and How](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797613504966){:target="_blank”} or these [great videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/geoffdcumming/videos){:target="_blank”} is an eye opener!

**2022 - February**

*Heintz, C., & Scott-Phillips, T. (2022). [Expression unleashed: The evolutionary & cognitive foundations of human communication.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983701/){:target="_blank"} Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 1-46. doi:10.1017/S0140525X22000012*

This target article defends the claim that the diversity of human expression is associated with an ensemble of cognitive capacities targeted at the expression/recognition of informative intentions. Grounded on the work of Grice (and many more since then) on cognitive pragmatics, the authors describe what is informative and communicative intentions through simple examples (see also this [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/thom_scott_phillips_how_communication_makes_us_human){:target="_blank”}) and define different types of inferences made by the audience: inferences about 1) others’ intentions, 2) others’ informative intentions, and 3) others’ communicative intentions. Whereas ostensive communication is not limited to language, it is a good reminder about its complexity. For a great introduction, read the inspiring book [Speaking our minds](https://thomscottphillips.com/book/){:target="_blank”} written by Thom Scott-Phillips.

Definitely looking forward to read the comments about the proposed cognitive capacities and their co-evolution!

*Wojcik, E.H., Lassman, D.J., & Vuvan, D.T. (2022). [Using a developmental-ecological approach to understand the relation between language and music.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.762018/full){:targets="_blank"} Frontiers in Psychology. 13:762018. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.762018* 

This short perspective article gives arguments to use a developmental-ecological approach in music-language studies. It has been repeatedly shown that implicit learning is key in development but what is the “real” input that we receive when growing up? Inspired by research in other fields (e.g., motor and semantic development), the authors defend that describing input in real life (and how it unfolds over time) is a good idea to document listeners experience (and understand better adult cognition). Of course, there are challenges (e.g., how can we code the input? is it music? language? do we even agree on that?) but it is a good reminder that lab experiments are limited and that “field” experiments in this domain could be helpful.
