**2022 - February**

*Heintz, C., & Scott-Phillips, T. (2022). [Expression unleashed: The evolutionary & cognitive foundations of human communication.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983701/){:target="_blank"} Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 1-46. doi:10.1017/S0140525X22000012*

This target article defends the claim that the diversity of human expression is associated with an ensemble of cognitive capacities targeted at the expression/recognition of informative intentions. 

Grounded on the work of Grice (and many more since then) on cognitive pragmatics, the authors describe what is informative and communicative intentions through simple examples (see also this [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/thom_scott_phillips_how_communication_makes_us_human){:target="_blank”}) and define different types of inferences made by the audience: inferences about 1) others’ intentions, 2) others’ informative intentions, and 3) others’ communicative intentions. Whereas ostensive communication is not limited to language, it is a good reminder about its complexity. For a great introduction, read the inspiring book [Speaking our minds](https://thomscottphillips.com/book/){:target="_blank”} written by Thom Scott-Phillips.

Definitely looking forward to read the comments about the proposed cognitive capacities and their co-evolution!

Talk by Iris van Rooij, at the Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science, and Semiotics & Interacting Minds Center, Aarhus University, 17-2-2022.* 

Iris van Rooij walks us through the task of Dr Conjectura who wants to solve a problem (i.e., to find an algorithm behind a certain function). It is an articulated demonstration that cognitive sciences is full of uncertainty and cannot be automated. Very thoughtful talk, challenging ideas, and a somehow positive final quote “Pluralism and indeterminacy are necessary for discovery”. I will definitely continue following her eye-opening tweets (@IrisVanRooij) and the [book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cognition-and-intractability/2FC21B94CCCFBBD1E11A2D30D4503A23){:target="_blank"} is on my list.
