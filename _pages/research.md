Whether it is music, speech, screams, or environmental sounds, **we make sense of sounds**. It seems trivial because it happens so rapidly and efficiently for most of us but its failure has serious consequences. To understand how it works (or does not work), I focus on different levels of analysis (à la Marr). Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the cognitive processes at play to make sense of sounds requires the definition of both the activities themselves (i.e., what does the system do/use and what is it good for) and the processes involved in performing such actions (i.e., how does it do it).

Concretely, my daily activities turn around the acoustic description of categories (or mental representation of something abstract such as correctness, beauty, communication intention) and how they are processed.

Here are some examples of current research projects:


Does it sound right? Perception of correctness in music
======

Listeners can easily say if a singer sounds in tune or out of tune (Larrouy-Maestri et al., 2013, 2015) and if a band plays on the beat or not. In fact, we are used to “categorize” what we hear and identify performances sounding wrong. However, as is true for several types of judgments (e.g., beauty or obscenity), the definition of ‘correctness’ in music lacks precision, and the foundation of such categorization remains unclear (Larrouy-Maestri, under review). This project examines what ‘correctness’ means in different musical contexts and the cognitive processes behind such categorization. To do so, we investigate auditory processing of manipulated sequences with methods from psychophysics, physiology and electrophysiology. By comparing ‘correctness’ perception across pitch and time dimensions and examining potential listeners’ profiles, this project aims at clarifying the mechanisms underlying music perception.


Sound categorization
======

Although we quickly identify sounds as music or speech or scream, how we form such abstract categories is not so clear. By examining ambiguous material such as sprechgesang (Merrill & Larrouy-Maestri, 2017) or performances from a West-African talking drum capable of speech surrogacy (Durojaye’’, Fink’’, Roeske, Wald-Fuhrmann, & Larrouy-Maestri, 2021), we clarified the association between music and speech categories and certain acoustic features as well as the role of familiarity with the material. On the other hand, observing the perception of non-verbal vocalisation informed us about the ambiguity of certain categories (Holz, Larrouy-Maestri, & Poeppel, 2021). With the help of Madita Hörster, we try to put together the pieces of the puzzle and figure out how we manage (or not) to categorise sounds. 


Cognitive process behind prosodic perception
======

The tone of the voice carries information about the emotional state or intention of a speaker. Whereas the nature of acoustic features of contrasted prosodic signals has attracted a lot of attention in the last decades (particularly since Banse & Scherer, 1996), the communication of emotions/intentions remains poorly understood. Also, most of listeners seem to share the ‘code’ (or interpret adequately a prosodic signal) to access emotions/intentions of speakers but misunderstandings easily occur.

This project focuses on the cognitive processes involved in prosody comprehension. More specifically, we examine the categorization of utterances based on the integration of dynamic acoustic information with methods from psychophysics and electrophysiology. By clarifying how listeners deal (or fail to deal) with acoustic information carried by the tone of voice, we aim at better understanding a crucial human ability, that is, the communication of emotions/intentions through speech.

Short to long timescales
======
Music, like speech, can be described as a continuous stream of sounds that is parsed in units of different length. While tones are usually defined as the smallest discrete unit in Western music, we recently provided empirical evidence for the specific role of smaller units in music: scoops, which are small dynamic pitch change at the start or end of sung notes within a melody (Larrouy-Maestri & Pfordresher, 2018, Larrouy-Maestri, Poeppel, & Pfordresher, in press). Together with Xiangbin Teng and David Poeppel, we focused on longer sequences and identified a neural signature that reliably tracks musical phrases (>5 seconds) online. Recently joined by Lea Fink and Zofia Hobubowska on this project, we further explore how such signature contributes to music listening behaviour/enjoyment.

By identifying relevant information at different timescales and understanding how humans deals with such information, this line of research aims at enlightening both music cognition and neurophysiological processing of auditory sequences.

Roots of singing preferences
======

As suggested by the many singing contests and music programs in the media, the singing voice attracts ample attention. Previous studies showed that lay and expert listeners share similar definitions of what is “correct” when listening to untrained (Larrouy-Maestri et al., 2015) and trained singers (Larrouy-Maestri et al., 2017). The definition of pitch accuracy (i.e., correctness) relies on specific acoustic features that can be measured. However, we usually don’t attend opera or pop concerts to evaluate the correctness of a performance but to enjoy it. With Camila Bruder, and the wise insights of Ed Vessel, David Poeppel, and Melanie Wald-Fuhrmann, we investigate what “preference” means when listening to sung performances, and to explore the roots of such aesthetic experience.
